			<h2 class="fs--h3 solid">What Is SURCA?</h2>
			<p><span class="fs--1200mx lh--1000mx" style="color: #a63d0f">SURCA is the component of <a href="https://showcase.wsu.edu/">Academic Showcase</a> that honors the contributions of undergraduate students to the scholarly output of Washington State University.</span> WSU undergraduates are regularly <strong>conducting research, pursuing scholarship, and/or engaging in creative activities</strong> in partnership with a mentor. As can be seen from attending our event, the students&#8217; efforts make <strong>original intellectual or creative contributions to a discipline</strong>. Moreover, SURCA invites undergraduate presenters who are in the early stages of their research as well as those who are more experienced. The Novice, Early Career, Crimson, and Gray awards provide students with all levels of experience an opportunity to compete for awards. <a href="/about/awards/">Awards</a> are made in <a href="/about/categories/">nine presentation categories</a>, which are mainly divided by disciplines.</p>
			<h3 class="fs--h6 gray-dark-text margined-top">Who Is Invited to SURCA?</h3>
			<p>Besides our student presenters, faculty, staff, post docs, and experts from the community are invited to be SURCA judges. Everyone is invited to attend the event and learn about the work of the next generation of experts. Faculty are invited to include SURCA as part of the learning requirements for their individual courses.</p>
			<h3 class="fs--h6 gray-dark-text margined-top">Who Organizes SURCA?</h3>
			<p>SURCA is hosted by the <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/">Office of Undergraduate Research</a>, part of the <a href="https://daesa.wsu.edu/">Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement</a> in the <a href="https://provost.wsu.edu/">Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="fs--h5 gray-dark-text">Its Name and Origins</h3>
			<p><span class="fs--1200mx lh--1000mx" style="color: #a63d0f">Since the beginning of Washington State College more than a century ago, undergraduates have been critical to the success and growth of the university.</span> As the state&#8217;s land-grant college, research has long been a primary pursuit of the institution.</p>
			<p>SURCA is part of <a href="https://showcase.wsu.edu/">WSU Showcase</a>, which includes a number of events such as the Academic Showcase poster exhibit for faculty, staff, and graduate and professional students; the Distinguished Faculty Address; and the Celebrating Excellence Banquet.</p>
