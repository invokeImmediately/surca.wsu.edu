			<h2 class="solid">Prior to SURCA</h2>
			<p>This section is periodically updated with dates and times of events that will help our students prepare for SURCA as it approaches. In general terms, however, we recommend students plan on doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Talk to your mentor about presenting at SURCA, making a poster, submitting your online application including an abstract describing your work, and so on. Remember that <a href="https://surca.wsu.edu/participants/guidelines/">applications are due online about a month before SURCA; <strong>the deadline for abstracts for the next SURCA is set for Feb. 20, 2020</strong>.</a></li>
				<li>Everyone submitting an abstract will be <strong>notified by March 6, 2020</strong> about presenting at the event.</li>
				<li>Attend a poster-making workshop or special new workshops on how to make an effective SURCA presentation. Two presentation workshops have been scheduled for Feb. 27 and March 4, both from 4-5 p.m., with locations TBA.</li>
				<li>Design your poster and have it printed <em>well in advance</em> of the March 30 event. Poster printers need time to make your poster, and demand for their services is typically high around the time of SURCA and WSU Showcase.</li>
			</ul>
