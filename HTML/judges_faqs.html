        <h3>Frequently Asked <mark class="highlight">Questions</mark></h3></div></section>
<dl class="faq toggled">
    <dt>I don't work at WSU...where can I park when I'm judging for SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p class="oue-normal">Parking will be available in the Smith Center for Undergraduate Education (CUE) parking garage, located a short distance from the CUB. A campus map showing the entrance to the Smith CUE parking garage <a href="http://map.wsu.edu/t/563E7ECA" title="WSU Campus Map: Smith CUE Parking Garage" target="_blank">can be found here</a>. Please notify the Office of Undergraduate Research at <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">UGresearch@wsu.edu</a> if you will need parking so that we can make sure you will not be charged for parking during SURCA.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Where do I stay?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p class="oue-normal">There are many hotels in the area and many provide complimentary transportation to and from campus. If you need to locate lodging, we encourage you to plan ahead and reserve a room early. Please feel free to contact the Office of Undergraduate Research at <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">UGresearch@wsu.edu</a> if you require assistance.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>One of my students that I mentor will be presenting at SURCA. Can I still judge?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p class="oue-normal">Absolutely. We will make sure that you are not assigned your student’s poster for judging in order to avoid any conflicts of interest. There is a place on the judge sign up form where you can list any undergraduate students that you are mentoring currently.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I am a graduate student, can I judge at SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p class="oue-normal">No, we do not allow graduate students to judge. We are always looking for helpers during SURCA and we would appreciate your help in other areas. If you are able to help please contact the Office of Undergraduate Research at <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">UGresearch@wsu.edu</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I'd like to judge at SURCA, how much time does it typically require? What is the difference between the informal vs. the formal judging period?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p class="oue-normal">Many judges indicate that they like the informal judging time (when students are not present), but others only attend during the formal judging period. We estimate that judges typically take between 15-30 minutes per poster, depending on their level of expertise with the particular subject area. Judges are usually assigned 2-4 posters, so please inform the SURCA organizing committee if you anticipate only coming during the formal judging period. <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">(UGresearch@wsu.edu)</a></p>
