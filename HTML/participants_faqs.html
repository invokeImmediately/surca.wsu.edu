<h2>FAQs from Student Participants</h2>
<p>Do you have questions about SURCA? Check these Frequently Asked Questions for answers!</p>
<dl class="faq toggled">
    <dt>Is it possible for WSU Global Campus students to participate in SURCA? How does that work?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Global campus students do have the opportunity to receive face to face feedback during SURCA via Blackboard software. We provide a laptop with a video camera “parked” next to a poster so that judges and interested audience members may speak with the student via headphones and the camera on the laptop. The student will still prepare a poster that will be hung for them at the event in Pullman. Bottom line – we are trying to simulate the exact experience for Global Campus students that Pullman students have. If the student would like to travel to Pullman for the event, that is a possibility too, and they should <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">contact the Office of Undergraduate Research</a> to explore options for travel funds.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Are students that graduate in December eligible to present at SURCA the following March?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>We do allow students that have graduated to present at SURCA – however, they are not eligible for any awards. But they are more than welcome to present. Students will receive feedback from the judges. <strong>But again, only currently enrolled students are eligible for awards at the SURCA event.</strong></p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Are pieces of artwork or other physical exhibits allowed to be presented during SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Yes, students may present artwork or other displays alongside their poster describing their research, scholarship, or creative activities. There is a place on the SURCA abstract submission form to indicate special needs such as a table to set your display on, extra space for other exhibits, or power to run a laptop.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Is it possible to submit two entries to SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Students may only be the primary author on one entry to be judged. They may submit a second entry; however, they will only be judged on one of the two entries. Furthermore, students may be listed as a co-presenter on other entries. If one of these entries wins an award, the award amount is shared by the student authors. Note that the window of time when students need to stand by their poster and speak with judges (3 total) is very short. Thus it would be impossible for a student to stand next to two posters and adequately address judge/audience questions. (Even if the posters are physically next to each other, this is difficult).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I conducted research last summer at another Institution. Can I still present this at SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Yes, absolutely; and we encourage you to present at SURCA. The only requirement regarding timing is that presentations must be about <strong>work performed as an undergraduate in the past year</strong> with the <strong>guidance of a mentor</strong>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>How do I know my application was received? And how do I know if I’ve been accepted?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>You should receive an automated email response within 3 days indicating that your application was received. You will also receive an email by early March indicating whether your abstract has been accepted or not. If you do not receive an email before spring break, please <a href="mailto:UGresearch@wsu.edu">contact the Office of Undergraduate Research</a> as it may indicate a problem with your email address.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>What is the difference between a co-presenter and other authors?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Students who work together on a research, scholarly, or creative project and make equal contributions to it should both apply to SURCA as co-presenters. Both students would then be expected to present during SURCA. Other authors involved in the project might include faculty members or graduate students who helped with your project.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>If I have a co-presenter and we win an award, do we both receive an award?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Yes. All co-presenters will receive a certificate and the award money will be split equally among the co-presenters.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why do I need to indicate how many semesters I have done research?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>We use this information to determine if you are eligible for the novice award.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>If I received an Undergraduate Research Scholarship (e.g. Auvil Scholars Fellowship, Scott and Linda Carson Excellence Award), which event am I expected to present at… the WSU Academic Showcase or SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Undergraduates, including undergraduate research scholarship recipients, are <strong>only eligible to present at SURCA</strong>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Are creative writing entries permitted for SURCA? There is very little information on the website about what to expect or how I would participate with a creative writing submission.</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>Yes. Creative writing entries are accepted for SURCA and should be submitted within the Arts and Design category. Any type of creative writing is welcome. A poster describing the motivation, background, methods or inspiration for the creative pieces should be prepared and presented alongside the writing. More information about what should be included on the poster is available on the SURCA website under the <a href="/units/undergraduateresearch/surca/participants/" target="_blank">Participant Information</a> section.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I have never made a poster before. Where do I begin? What size should it be?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>The SURCA website has a lot of tips on creating a poster along with examples, which are all organized under the <a href="/units/undergraduateresearch/SURCA/participants/posterpresentations/" title="View tips on creating and presenting posters" target="_blank">Presenting a Poster</a> section. Look for workshops hosted by the <a href="http://UndergraduateResearch.wsu.edu" title="Home page of the WSU Office of Undergraduate Research" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate Research</a> to help with creating a poster. Also stop in and visit the drop-in tutors, who can help you with your poster questions. Hours are posted on the <a href="http://UndergraduateResearch.wsu.edu" title="Home page of the WSU Office of Undergraduate Research" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate Research home page</a>. Finally, work with your faculty mentor or graduate student mentor to format your work in a poster. <strong>Posters at SURCA are limited to 4' high by 5'4" wide</strong>; they can be smaller, but cannot be larger than this.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Where can I have my poster printed?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>After you create your poster, you can have it printed wherever you like. There are multiple services available on the Pullman campus, and they are listed on the SURCA website under the <a href="/units/undergraduateresearch/SURCA/participants/posterpresentations/#whereToPrint" title="Poster printing services" target="_blank">Presenting a Poster</a> section. Be sure to check with wherever you are having your poster printed to allow enough time to meet your deadline. Avoid the last-minute rush!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why haven’t I known about SURCA before?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>SURCA was first held in 2012, and has its roots in older events. It allows many programs across the university to combine efforts and seize economies of scale by providing a single venue in which undergraduates can share their mentored “research, scholarship, and creative activities that make an original intellectual or creative contribution to their discipline.”</p>
        <p>SURCA is the “next generation” of the former Undergraduate Research Symposium, which was the first single event open to all students (freshmen through seniors) in all majors. The planning for SURCA as a new event evolved over a period; a provostial decision in January 2012 allowed SURCA to be held in conjunction with WSU Showcase (which includes Academic Showcase, a poster event for faculty, staff, graduate and professional students). For the first three years, SURCA was held on the same day as Academic Showcase. Beginning in 2015, SURCA is now held on a different day due to growth of the event.</p>
        <p><a href="http://surca.wsu.edu" title="SURCA home page" target="_blank">Our website</a> gives much more information about the event, and it is updated frequently with the latest news.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Which category is the best category for students in my department?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>It always depends on the research or creative activity. There is no one “best” category. A careful reading of SURCA’s Participation Categories will be very helpful for every student and mentor as they decide which category best applies to their research.</p>
        <p>For example, in a diverse department like Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design some students may submit in the Engineering and Physical Sciences category; others might submit in the Social Sciences or Arts and Design categories, depending on their work.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Can Running Start students apply to participate in SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Yes!</strong> Running Start students can apply; if they are enrolled as WSU students, their entries can be judged and be eligible for awards.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I have made some progress in my research project but, at this time, I’m afraid I don’t have any “new” results. Should I still participate in SURCA?</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p><strong>Yes,</strong> definitely! We feel it's important to disseminate your knowledge as part of the research experience. Don't worry about “not having any results” because you will still have plenty to share about the goals of your research, your methods, your motivation for this type of work, etc. Research takes time, and we are excited to hear about yours at all stages.</p>
        <p>In SURCA, there are categories for “early career” and “novice” researchers, so depending on how long you have done your work, you may be eligible for an award in these areas.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>How will my presentation be judged? I’ve never presented my research before.</dt>
    <dd style="display: none;">
        <p>The<strong> <a href="/units/undergraduateresearch/SURCA/docsart/2014-OUE-SURCArubric1-17-14.pdf" target="_blank">judging rubric </a></strong>is available for you to review ahead of time, and it is recommended that you are familiar with the rubric. Practice your presentations with your roommate, your friends, and your mentor. Remember, some judges may know a little about your area of research and some may not have any previous knowledge about your research. So be prepared to talk to people from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>
