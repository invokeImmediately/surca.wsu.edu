			<p>Dear Students and Scholars:</p>
			<p>We have been looking forward to the exciting exchange of ideas that happens each year at Showcase, the University’s weeklong celebration of academic excellence. However, in recent weeks we have been concerned about the risk that the <a href="https://wsu.edu/covid-19/">COVID-19 outbreak</a> presents to the health of Showcase participants and attendees.</p>
			<p>After careful assessment, we have made the difficult decision to cancel this year’s Showcase poster sessions: Academic Showcase, Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) Research Exposition, and Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA).</p>
			<p>We recognize that you have worked diligently to prepare your presentations for these events. Please know that event organizers are exploring alternate formats for sharing your research and creative work, and will keep you updated as plans take shape. In the meantime, feel free to include your Showcase presentation in your curriculum vitae (CV) or resume.</p>
			<p>Additional Showcase events are also affected. This month the State of the University Address will be delivered exclusively in an online format. The Distinguished Faculty Address, Celebrating Excellence Banquet, and Emeritus Society Legacy of Excellence Lecture will be postponed until fall. Information will be available soon about plans for Crimson Reads and the Three-Minute Thesis.</p>
			<p>For more than a dozen years, Showcase has been a central part of WSU’s academic culture. Never before have we had to cancel these sessions and forfeit the opportunity to share our research findings and innovations in person. Regardless of this disappointing turn of events, we know that you will continue your outstanding work and seek future opportunities to share it widely.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p><strong>Mary Sánchez Lanier, Ph.D.</strong><br />Assistant Vice Provost<br />Chair, Academic Showcase Committee</p>
			<p><strong>Yini Chen</strong><br />Awards and Scholarship Chair<br />Graduate and Professional Student Association</p>
