<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<h3>A Note to Students in Business, Communications, Humanities, and Creative Arts</h3>
<p class="oue-normal">Science and engineering fields have traditionally used a poster format to present their research, but many students (and even faculty) in other fields are less familiar with this format.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">A poster is really just a visual aid containing a summary of your work in very large type that facilitates an effective discussion of your activities. One helpful way to conceptualize it is to envision it as a series of PowerPoint slides integrated into a single poster. You generally start with the abstract, which summarizes your work. This is followed by an introduction which provides some background and addresses the “why” driving your work. Your methods would be whatever you did to accomplish the activity. Perhaps your method was to go to the archives of the library or a history museum to gather information. It could be as simple as using an oil paint on a canvas, or as complicated as a rigorous statistical analysis. The results of your work should be presented next, and might consist of a book, an article, a piece of art, a sculpture, an item of clothing, or any number of possibilities. Finally, the conclusions of your work would generally tell us what you learned—and thereby explain to us what we should learn from your work and how human knowledge was advanced by it.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="oneLineAfter"><a href="/participants/poster-presentations/"><img class="linked" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/706/2015/11/surca-poster-presentations.jpg"><br><b>More Information on Preparing Poster Presentations</b></a></div>
<p class="oue-normal">The poster presentation itself is simply an oral presentation that has been prepared for many different individuals with many distinct interests. However, one of the key strengths of the poster presentation format is the increased capacity for back-and-forth discussion between the presenter and the audience.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">Format: Some work just demands a space that goes beyond the poster. Tables and electricity are available and your need for these should be indicated in your on line application.</p>
<hr class="subSection"><br>
<h3>A Note to Students Who Do Not Yet Have a Lot of Data</h3>
<p class="oue-normal">The purpose of SURCA is to give students an opportunity to present their work. Awards are available for students with various experience and education levels. Take advantage of this opportunity. Perhaps SURCA will lead to a national presentation.</p>
