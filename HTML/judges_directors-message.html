			<p><a href="/judges/sign-up/">If you have volunteered as a judge</a> at the annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA), <em>thank you</em>. If you are thinking about volunteering as a judge, <em>we need you</em>.</p>
			<p>We could not have this event without our wonderful volunteer judges. More importantly, each and every student participant appreciates the opportunity to meet you and explain their work that makes an original intellectual or creative contribution to a discipline. They may do that by exploring research, deepening their scholarship, or embracing creative activities. With your valued input, SURCA takes its place as a truly unique and high-impact event.</p>
			<p>I look forward to seeing you at SURCA this year. Thank you for sharing with WSU students your time and expertise!</p>
