<h2>Welcome to SURCA!</h2>
<img class="autoScaledToQuarter shiftToRight" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/706/2015/11/vice-provost-mary-wack.jpg">
<p class="oue-normal">The Office of Undergraduate Education at Washington State University is proud to host the annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities. SURCA is <i>about</i> and <i>for</i> our undergraduates. It is the premier opportunity for those in all majors, on every campus, to share the results of their faculty-mentored research, scholarship, and creative activities throughout an afternoon of oral and poster presentations. Our <a href="http://UndergraduateResearch.wsu.edu" target="_blank">Office of Undergraduate Research</a> organizes SURCA.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">In this celebration of students’ achievements and academic excellence, it is important to recognize the broad community that supports the students’ efforts. The scope and depth of the students’ research are made possible by the caring efforts of countless faculty members who serve as mentors. Those who include undergraduates on their ground-breaking research teams or by their side in the studio, archives, or other creative venue create high-impact learning activities for each of those creative, disciplined thinkers.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">We recognize the many dedicated individuals who work to make SURCA a success. The faculty, staff, and external judges who lend their expertise and time to evaluate and provide feedback on the students’ projects are invaluable members of the SURCA team.  It includes those who serve on <a href="/overview/committee/">the organizing and staging committee</a> and the project leader, Dr. Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">We also deeply thank those who support SURCA financially and provide scholarships to student researchers.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">SURCA is one of four events that make up WSU Showcase, a day set aside to highlight faculty, staff, and student accomplishments; the three additional events are Academic Showcase, the Distinguished Faculty Address, and the Celebration of Excellence Dinner.  The Office of the Provost continues to invest in SURCA, as do generous donors, alumni, and friends of the Office of Undergraduate Research.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">I trust that you will enjoy SURCA and the chance to interact first-hand with the students, judges, faculty mentors, donors, and others who make this a great showcase event and tradition at WSU.</p>
<p class="oue-normal"><b><span class="larger-text">--Mary F. Wack, Ph. D.</span></b><br> Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>
