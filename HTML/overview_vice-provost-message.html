			<h2>Welcome to SURCA!</h2>
			<p><img class="flt--right ml--1000mx mb--1000mx w--25pct" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/706/2015/11/vice-provost-mary-wack.jpg" /><strong>WSU Undergraduate Education at Washington State University is proud to host the annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities.</strong> SURCA is <em>about</em> and <em>for</em> our undergraduates. It is the premier opportunity for those in all majors, on every campus, to share the results of their faculty-mentored research, scholarship, and creative activities throughout an afternoon of poster presentations. Our <a href="http://UndergraduateResearch.wsu.edu">Office of Undergraduate Research</a> organizes SURCA, and generous donors make it possible to make awards to top presenters.</p>
			<p>In this celebration of students’ achievements and academic excellence, it is important to recognize the broad community that supports the students’ efforts. The scope and depth of the students’ research are made possible by the caring efforts of countless faculty members who serve as mentors. They include undergraduates on their ground-breaking research teams and work side-by-side in labs, studios, archives, or other creative venues to create high-impact learning experiences for the students.</p>
			<p>We recognize the many dedicated individuals who work to make SURCA a success. The faculty, staff, and external judges who lend their expertise and time to evaluate and provide feedback on the students’ projects are invaluable members of the SURCA team. It includes those who serve on <a href="/overview/committee/">the organizing committee</a> and the project leader, Dr. Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research.</p>
			<p>We also deeply thank those who support SURCA financially. With each gift, they are making an investment in students who go the extra mile to get involved with research at WSU and help to create new knowledge in their discipline. Thanks to these donors, hundreds of top presenters at SURCA have received awards over the years.</p>
			<p>SURCA is one of the set of events that make up WSU Showcase, a week set aside to highlight faculty, staff, and student accomplishments. I trust that you will enjoy SURCA and the chance to interact one-to-one with the students, judges, faculty mentors, donors, and others who make this a great showcase event a proud tradition at WSU.</p>
