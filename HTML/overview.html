			<h2 class="solid">What is SURCA?</h2>
			<p>Washington State University undergraduates are<strong> conducting research, pursuing scholarship, and/or involved in creative activities</strong> in <strong>partnership with a mentor</strong>. The students&#8217; efforts make <strong>original intellectual or creative contributions to a discipline</strong>. SURCA invites undergraduate presenters who are in the early stages of their research as well as those who are more experienced. The Novice, Early Career, Crimson, and Gray awards provide students with all levels of experience an opportunity to compete for awards. Awards are made in eight categories of disciplines.</p>
			<p>Faculty, staff, post docs, and experts from the community are invited to be SURCA judges. Everyone is invited to attend the event and learn about the work of the next generation of experts. Faculty are invited to include SURCA as part of the learning requirements for their individual courses.</p>

			<h2 class="solid">History of SURCA</h2>
			<h3>Its Name and Origins</h3>
			<p>Since the beginning of Washington State College more than a century ago, undergraduates have been critical to the success and growth of the university. As the state&#8217;s land-grant college, research has long been a primary pursuit of the institution.</p>
			<p>SURCA is part of <a href="https://showcase.wsu.edu/">WSU Showcase</a>, and is one of four events that make up that annual WSU tradition. The three other WSU Showcase events include the Academic Showcase poster exhibit for faculty, staff, and graduate and professional students; the Distinguished Faculty Address; and the Celebrating Excellence Banquet.</p>
			<p><strong>&#8220;Surca&#8221; in Spanish means &#8220;tills&#8221; and &#8220;furroughs.&#8221;</strong> In the case of SURCA, its name, then, is an acronym that also symbolically refers to the hard work that goes into the students&#8217; research process so that something new can grow and flourish.</p>
