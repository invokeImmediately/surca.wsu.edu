			<p>As noted above, <strong>SURCA 2020 has been canceled</strong> due to concerns over the COVID-19 outbreak and the application for judging at SURCA 2020 is now closed. We will, however, certainly need judges for SURCA 2021. Please check back late in fall semester 2020 to sign up for judging at SURCA 2021.</p></p>
