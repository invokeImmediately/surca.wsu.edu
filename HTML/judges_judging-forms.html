			<p>Below, you can view the forms that judges will use to evaluate the presentations of student participants of SURCA and provide their feedback.</p>
			<p><strong><u>Note</u>: copies of these forms will be provided to judges on the day of the event</strong> by SURCA staff, so there is no need for judges to bring their own copies. They are included here on the website so that judges can familiarize themselves ahead of time with the criteria they will be working with to judge presentations, and to give students an idea of how they will be evaluated.</p>
