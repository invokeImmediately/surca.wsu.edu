Carey Senior Ballroom. Awards will begin at 5:00 p.m. in the CUB Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>SURCA is the unique opportunity for students from all majors, grades, and campuses to present their mentored research, scholarship, and creative activities on posters, and win awards in eight categories that same day.  It’s presented by the Office of Undergraduate Research, part of WSU Undergraduate Education. This year, SURCA is the first event of the <a href="https://showcase.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">WSU Showcase Week</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>“We have 230 undergraduates presenting 206 presentations at SURCA this year,” said Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research. “More than 170 expert judges have volunteered their time to evaluate these presentations.”</p> 
<p>“SURCA gives students tremendous opportunities to grow both personally and academically,” said Mary Sánchez Lanier, assistant vice provost. “Students must refine and organize knowledge gleaned from their months and even years of work with a research mentor. They must prepare detailed posters and deliver concise speeches to tell various audiences about their work and results. At the event itself, they learn about the wealth of subjects being investigated by their peers.”</p>
<p>“Participants from years past tell us that their understanding of the scope of their work as well as their commitment to research was deepened by their SURCA experience.”</p>
