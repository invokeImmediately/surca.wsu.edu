			<h2 id="classAttendance" class="crimson-text h3-fs solid">Faculty Who Are Teaching Spring Classes</h3>
			<p>We encourage you to include SURCA attendance and assignments as part of your class. If you would like students to register at SURCA to demonstrate attendance, please send the name and number of your course, along with the number of enrolled students, to <a href="mailto:UG.research@wsu.edu">UG.research@wsu.edu</a>. We can then provide information to you after the event including the names/IDs of your students that attended.</p>
			<h3 id="test" class="h4-fs">Having Your Class Present Posters</h3>
			<p>If you are teaching a course and would like to include the production of a poster in the course requirement with possible SURCA participation in mind, this is exactly the type of activity that we highly encourage. Students may work on teams and submit their abstract as co-presenters, or they may work individually. Regardless, it’s still important that the students have a faculty mentor to guide them on their progress.</p>
			<h2 class="crimson-text h3-fs solid">Mentors of Undergraduate Presenters</h2>
			<p>We welcome you to both the SURCA poster session and the awards ceremony. Mentors will be recognized along with their award-winning students at the award ceremony. <strong>We also encourage you to <a href="/judges/">serve as a judge at SURCA</a></strong>—your experience with mentoring your own students makes you well suited to evaluate other students&#8217; posters and presentations.</p>
			<h2 class="crimson-text h3-fs solid">WSU Faculty, Staff, and Community</h2>
			<p>We welcome you to the SURCA poster session and awards ceremony. If you have any questions about the event please contact us at <a href="mailto:UG.research@wsu.edu">UG.research@wsu.edu</a>.</p>
