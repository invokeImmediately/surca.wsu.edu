			<h3 id="research-proposal">Research Proposal <em>(New for 2021)</em></h3>
			<p>This category, which is new to SURCA 2021, is for students working with a mentor and engaged in developing and writing a research or creative or scholarly work proposal that identifies a knowledge gap via the inclusion of a literature review and an analysis of existing data such as is available in public data bases, published literature, or data from the research lab. The knowledge gap should be addressed by a proposed experimental or future research plan followed by expected outcomes. All students selecting this category must also specify one of the other 8 categories.</p>
			<h3>Arts and Design</h3>
			<p>This category is for creative activities in arts and design and would embrace a variety of areas including, but not limited to, apparel design, textiles, architecture, art (in all its forms), creative writing, dance, film, music, performance, journalistic products, and multimedia.</p>
			<h3>Applied Sciences</h3>
			<p>This category is for research that seeks to solve a practical problem through the use of natural science. Applied science differs from fundamental science, which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications.</p>
			<h3>Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, and Information Sciences</h3>
			<p>This category is for projects in pure mathematics or computational studies as well as those areas of research that deal with the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, or dissemination of information.</p>
			<h3>Engineering and Physical Sciences</h3>
			<p>This category encompasses any research done in areas such as chemistry, engineering, environmental, physical sciences, geology, materials science, physics, or resource sciences.</p>

Projects in these areas can be from diverse fields of the biological sciences such as evolutionary biology, developmental biology, neuroscience, microbiology, genetics, and molecular plant sciences.</p>
			<h3>Organismal, Population, Ecological, and Evolutionary Biology</h3>
			<p>This category is for research that deals with the analysis of physiology, morphology, reproduction, and behavior of organisms, the establishment of adaptations over evolutionary time, organismal interactions in the environment, and population, species, and community ecology. Biological systems studied in this category will range from viruses and bacteria to soil, plants, and animals.</p>
			<h3>Social Sciences</h3>
			<p>This category is for research in the field of study concerned with &#8220;society.&#8221; Research and scholarship in this category would embrace the various branches of the social sciences including, but not limited to, anthropology, communication, criminal Justice, economics, education, geography, history, human development, international studies, law, linguistics, management, political science, psychology, sociology, teaching &amp; learning.
