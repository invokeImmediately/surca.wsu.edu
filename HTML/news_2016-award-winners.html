<p class="oue-normal"><b>PULLMAN, Wash.</b>—At Washington State University’s largest-ever Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA) on March 28, 52 of the 231 students presenting just over 200 posters landed a total of 46 awards, announced <strong>Shelley Pressley</strong>, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research, event host.</p><!--more-->
<p class="oue-normal">The awards are valued at $10,300. That breaks down to 20 $300 crimson awards (the highest possible), 17 $200 gray awards (the second highest), 7 $100 novice awards (for students working up to two semesters on their research and who show exceptional promise), and 2 $100 early career awards (for freshmen and sophomores only).</p>
<h4>WSU-wide participation</h4>
<p class="oue-normal">Awards were made in each of SURCA’s eight participation categories, which are purposely designed to cover every major in all disciplines across the institution. The number of awards possible in each category is determined by the number of students participating in that category. The molecular, cellular, and chemical biology category was the largest with 49 posters presented by 50 students; 12 students presenting 12 posters earned scores that qualified for awards.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">The second most popular category—social sciences—had 50 participants; 10 of those presenting 9 posters won awards. The category with the fewest presenters—7 in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and information sciences—had 1 awardee.</p>
<h4>Strong presentations</h4>
<p class="oue-normal">“There were so many strong presentations,” said <strong>Mary F. Wack</strong>, WSU vice provost for Undergraduate Education, at the awards ceremony. “I was inspired to observe firsthand the knowledge, excitement, and passion all of the students brought to their projects.”</p>
<p class="oue-normal">She told the students that “with your mentors, you are creating solutions to societal, technical, and many more types of problems, and you are generating vast amounts of new knowledge. The university, the state of Washington, our nation, and the world will benefit from your efforts. For that, you are all winners.”</p>
<h4>Presenters bring success</h4>
<p class="oue-normal"><strong>Mary Sánchez Lanier</strong>, assistant vice provost, thanked all participants, their mentors, judges, volunteers, and sponsors of the fifth annual poster event, which is open to students in all grades and majors on every campus in the WSU system. Sponsors included: Alturas Analytics, The Boeing Company, Decagon Devices, the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship program, and the WSU Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">“It is the great numbers of people who believe in undergraduate research that make an event like SURCA possible, but it is the student researchers themselves who make it successful, and by all measures, SURCA 2016 was a great success,” said Sánchez Lanier. “At our top research university, we can be very proud of every participant and their tenacious pursuit of knowledge.”</p>
<h4>Celebrating five years</h4>
<p class="oue-normal">SURCA 2016 marks the fifth year that students participating in mentored research, scholarship, and creative activities made public presentations on their work, and “it is this exchange of information that advances all fields of scholarship,” Sanchez said. The day of the event—March 28—marked the 126th anniversary of Washington State University as well. And 2016 is also the year that the Office of Undergraduate Research, which is part of WSU Undergraduate Education, celebrates its 10th anniversary. SURCA is traditionally the closing event for WSU Showcase Week.</p>
